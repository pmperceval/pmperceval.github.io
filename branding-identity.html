I thoroughly enjoy design, and relish the satisfying experience of taking a design concept through the development process and into a viable branding or marketing strategy. I've had a number of such satisfying experiences, with the following some of my recent examples:

They have been steadily growing each quarter and were intersted in doing a rebranding of their logo. They still wanted to convey the idea that they were an outdoor focused organization but also have a clean and contemporary design aesthetic to their branding. These are two comps that I came up with that implemented the juxtaposition of the clean and modern with the wild  and rugged nature of the outdoors. </p>

                    <p align="center">The logo redesign for Eye Four Records was commissioned to me by Dave Plakon (owner, engineer, producer @ North Ave Studios). The original was composed of four bars forming a rectangle and Dave was explicit about his desire to keep the bars. I wanted the logo to be more than a literal 4 'I's and to really tie the image into the concept of a record label based out of North Ave Studios. I came up with the idea of turning the bars into meters like those found on visual play back on tracks or the channels of a sound board. I chose to place the image in a circle rather than sticking with the rectangle to make the logo more dynamic and less monotonous. </p>

                    <p align="center">Pensacola Bay Oyster Company is premium oyster farm based out of Pensacola, FL that is proud to be one of only farms located on our Gulf Coast. I was commissioned to do an entire branding package for PBO. This is still a project in progress that will eventually include many forms of merchandise, letter heads, business cards, packaging, and web design. PBO wants to stand out as an oyster company that is delivering a premium product and they wanted a very classic yet modern feel to the logo that delivered that idea of being a classy and premium product. An Oyster that stands a part from the rest to say. I hand drew an oyster and then combined it with a badge vector and type faces that juxtapose to convey a bold contemporary feeling with a professional and classic refinement.

The target demographic was 20-30 year fashion conscious young males that might be considered to be members of the hipster crowd. We came up with a design that combined hipster edginess with refined classicism. The design was hand drawn and imported into photoshop and illustrator.

They wanted a hand drawn feel and something that could be universally applied to merchandise such as tote bags, T-shirts, and koozies. I commissioned two pieces for them one that was a literal image that had a punk art feel and the other was a simple clean hand drawn abstract piece with Futura type face placed over top for the clean and modern look juxtaposed against messy hand drawn lines.
